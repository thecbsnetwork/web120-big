    <p>The web development and design community is in agreement and has been for some time: mobile apps are a stronger asset to an organization than a responsive website. For at least five years, apps have been regarded as the better choice. Of course, the common rhetoric is to assess your business's needs first but most organizations and businesses need to have both a responsive website and an app. A business that features both can easily introduce customers to their product and services while also maintaining a customizable, superior user interface for the customer's specific needs.<br /><br />But what are the best features of responsive sites and mobile apps? If you are looking for an interactive user experience with brand recognition and good integration into a mobile phone with things like GPS, then an app is the way to go. A mobile version of a site that contains basic information like open hours and location, and can be cheaply created with CSS media queries and easily updated. However, if your business’s goal is to create memorable experiences with customers who value the experience of interacting with your brand, then a responsive website won't be enough.</p>

        </ul>
    <p>There is no reason why an organization cannot have both. Personally, I prefer to use responsive sites instead of apps because I feel like I have more flexibility as a user and I'm not overusing my device. I use responsive sites for my favorite news sites, as well as Facebook. I prefer to have choice in how I engage with the internet and responsive sites allow me to do so. I am often willing to forgo the added benefits for autonomy. Sometimes, I even feel like apps separate me from the internet since I cannot always easily search for something if I’m using an app.<br /><br />However, I recognize the ability of an organization being able to offer premium access to content through an app that can't be easily offered on a website. Not every organization has access to a good developer or funds to pay that person well enough to develop an app. <a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/6783-mobile-website-vs-mobile-app.html" target="_blank">Business News Daily's Mona Bushnell</a> said it best:</p><blockquote>For some time, apps, websites and mobile websites all existed in separate buckets, but now, responsive websites are becoming the norm and the lines are blurring.</blockquote><p>In web design, it is not merely about what is the best path to follow, it's about how many different paths exist and how much energy should be invested into each one.</p>
