    <p>Flexbox is a more efficient way of creating layout for a web page, because it aligns elements and distributes the space around them, even if their dimensions are unknown or dynamic. To use Flexbox, you code a parent element and container elements and use specific CSS guidelines to design the items in the container in a multitude of ways for a <a href="siteapp.php">mobile app or small-scale website</a>. Originally developed to ease the creation of responsive sites, Flexbox does not use floats or positioning, so it's more inclusive. By not being restricted to languages read left-to-right, Flexbox can be used with all languages.
        <br /><br />
    Before Flexbox, there was primarily two-column magazine layout as the only option for web design. Now there are many more options, and Flexbox creates even more. <a href="https://caniuse.com/flexbox" target="_blank">Flexbox is now well-integrated to most desktop browsers</a>. Before it was so well integrated, developers created shims, which used JavaScript to make websites laid out with Flexbox backwards-compatible. Shims and CSS polyfills were the best way to ensure that your layout and design could be forward- and backwards-compatible. But now, even the <a href="https://philipwalton.github.io/polyfill/" target="_blank">developer behind the popular Polyfill shim</a> does not support their own creation:</p>
<blockquote>Update &#40;2016-12-22&#41;: I am no longer supporting this library for all the reasons I address in my post The Dark Side of Polyfilling CSS. If you choose to use this library, please make sure you read the post, so you fully understand the challenges and limitations involved in writing CSS polyfills.</blockquote>
    <p>Flexbox is widely considered to be the future of web layout design, with the exception of large scale gridded websites. Several sites give step-by-step tutorials for how to use Flexbox and start to integrate into a layout. The first results in a Google search come up with <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">CSS Tricks</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a>. CSS Tricks does provide an often-cited article by Chris Coyier, but <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a> provides the best explanation of Flexbox. MDN also includes a lot of detailed explanations and examples you can experiment with. Another strong and detailed lesson about what Flexboxes are and how to use them can also be found at <a href="https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/flexbox/" target="_blank">Interneting is Hard</a>.</p>
