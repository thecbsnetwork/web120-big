    <p>In the modern world, &ldquo;content is king,&rdquo; but content can take several forms. It isn’t solely restricted to text. A strong, dramatic photograph can create a professional look and feel for a website. Several strong, dramatic photographs can ensure the website looks inviting and encourages users to stay and interact. A gallery of photographs equipped with built-in or automatic controls immerses the user in what the website offers as they view every photograph.
        <br /><br />
    There are several ways to include a photo gallery in a website, dependent on how it is included, either with HTML5 or jQuery or JavaScript, and what it looks like, whether it’s minimal or includes a lot of features. There are several websites that list all of the best galleries that are either free to download or are available for one-time purchases and long-term subscriptions. Also, they can be built with <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cSS/css_image_gallery.asp" target="_blank">copying and pasting pre-written code</a>, or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_portfolio_gallery.asp" target="_blank">writing basic HTML and applying knowledge of tables and CSS</a>.
        <br /><br />
    I attempted to track down a strong video showcasing how to build an HTML5 gallery from scratch to embed here but all of the examples I found used <span class="pre">&lt;div&gt;</span> tags instead of <span class="pre">&lt;figure&gt;</span> and <span class="pre">&lt;figcaption&gt;</span>. Considering the incredible opportunity for increased accessibility for users of all types with <span class="pre">&lt;figure&gt;</span> and <span class="pre">&lt;figcaption&gt;</span> included in the code, I can’t embed a nice video here at this time. I can direct you to <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-the-right-way-to-use-figure-and-figcaption-elements/" target="_blank">two great</a> <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-consider-wrapping-your-code-with-a-figure-element--cms-21646" target="_blank">quick tips</a> that explain why and how to use <span class="pre">&lt;figure&gt;</span> though!
        <br /><br />
    When choosing the best HTML table for a website, it’s also important to factor in whether or not the site will be primarily viewed on mobile devices. If so, it might be best to include a gallery that is built with jQuery Mobile with a plug-in. CodeGeekz has curated a list of the <a href="https://codegeekz.com/best-jquery-mobile-slider-plugins/" target="_blank">15 best jQuery mobile plug-ins</a> that has a lot of great options.

    After starting my research, I am already a big fan of <a href="http://idangero.us/swiper/" target="_blank">Swiper</a>. It’s completely free and open source. The website is beautiful and clear and the gallery works really well on all devices.</p>
