    <p>No mistake, parallax scrolling effect on a website looks cool. It’s a great way to elevate a simple looking page. A single page website with images and minimal text can look incredibly more dramatic with parallax. An effect that occurs in nature when the position of an object looks different from different directions at varying speeds, parallax is used on camera, in video games, and now in website design. To implement it in a website, you can use CSS and HTML or JavaScript through a jQuery plugin. There are a dozen tutorials one can easily follow for a desktop web design. I especially liked <a href="https://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/" target="_blank">Keith Clark's</a> tutorial and <a href="https://1stwebdesigner.com/parallax-scrolling-tutorial/" target="_blank">1st Web Designer</a> because of how the former labelled each section clearly and the latter for the excellent and clear detail.
        <br /><br />
<a href="https://1stwebdesigner.com/parallax-scrolling-tutorial/" target="_blank">1st Web Designer</a> also includes the best history and titles for the different approaches for achieving parallax scrolling effect. &#40;As with any web design element, there are multiple ways to accomplish the same result.&#41;
<ul>
    <li>The Layered Method&mdash;The use of multiple backgrounds that can move independently horizontally or vertically, depending on your preference, and can be composited on one another.</li>
    <li>The Sprite Method&mdash;Simply put, using one big image comprised of multiple images that displays only parts of that said image when at different positions. A commonly used effect in navigation menus.</li>
    <li>The Repeating Pattern Method&mdash;Scrolling displays built up of individual tiles can be made to float over a repeating background layer.</li>
    <li>The Raster Method&mdash;Lines of pixels in an image are typically composited and refreshed in top-to-bottom order with a slight delay between drawing one line and drawing the next line.</li>
</ul>
CSS is a simple and straightforward way to accomplish the scroll, but it can also be done with jQuery. There are so many jQuery plugins available, it’s almost overwhelming. Several sites list all of the plugins like <a href="https://beebom.com/best-parallax-scrolling-plugins/" target="_blank">Beebom</a>, <a href="https://jqueryhouse.com/12-jquery-parallax-plugins/" target="_blank">jQuery House</a>, and <a href="https://www.jqueryscript.net/blog/Top-50-Best-Parallax-Scroll-Effect-jQuery-Plugins.html" target="_blank">jQuery Script</a>. However, many sites warn against using JavaScript since it makes the website take much longer to load all of the JavaScript and can use images that are far too large.
    <br /><br />
And, parallax scrolling just doesn’t work on mobile. After a quick google search of &lsquo;parallax mobile&rsquo; the top results included a blog post from <a href="http://www.designyourway.net/drb/how-the-web-design-trend-of-parallax-scrolling-has-faded/" target="_blank">Design Your Way</a> about how the trend has faded away &#40;Although there’s no year included so it’s not easy to determine how recent it is.&#41; and forum discussions about work-arounds. CSS media queries can help make parallax work on mobile by either shrinking the size of the images or eliminating it all together, but the work-arounds seem labor intensive. Parallax may look cool, but a look and feel can be accomplished in a static website using Bootstrap or something similar.
    <br /><br />
I think if a client really wants to include parallax scrolling in their website design then it should be used and it seems easy enough to do with CSS, but it’s not something to be used in every single site design.
