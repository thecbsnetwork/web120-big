    <p>Shopping carts are one of the many ways someone can monetize a website. In order to monetize a blog or a website, the creator can include advertisements, do product reviews, or sell products. For creators who are interested in selling products or merchandise, having an online shopping cart is the best way to do so. But is it better to buy into one of the existing eCommerce sites or to create one on your own?
        <br /><br />
    If you are creating a website through a pre-built web content management system like <a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/website" target="_blank">Wix</a> or <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Squarespace</a>, they already have built-in ways to set up an eCommerce system with their product. But <a href="https://www.shopify.com/online-store" target="_blank">Shopify</a> is a site that exists outside of a specific CMS but allows the non-technically minded person to setup a online shopping cart in a matter of mere minutes. But if you're already creating a website with handwritten HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, then using tools like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLJUQKOMIJg" target="_blank">PHP and MySql</a> or any open source method like <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/" target="_blank">Wordpress's WooCommerce</a> shouldn't be too complicated. It  all depends on what your goals are.
        <br /><br />
    Business-focused creators who are primarily concerned with the user experience of their customers are more likely to benefit from a pre-built online shopping cart experience. Those who have developer skills or work well with a developer may be more interested in an open source format for creating a shopping cart since there are many customizable options. I can also see something like WooCommerce from Wordpress being the best option for a small organization that already uses Wordpress and needs to sell a small number of items in frequently.
        <br /><br />
    Sites like Shopify are not free to use and are intended to be integrated into your existing site. It also has the ability to grow with your business, especially if you're focused on that kind of growth and not the detailed coding of the shopping cart itself.</p>
